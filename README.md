Watchdog is a Discord bot, which runs off of a database filled with baddies. WatchDog keeps these baddies away from all servers which it has access to!

## Appeal bans
So, you might've gotten yourself banned... Well, fret not! You can appeal your ban through the WatchDog Appeal Server, and have a moderator re-evaluate your ban! [Join the WatchDog Appeal Server!](https://discord.gg/J9YVWgF)

## Adding WatchDog to keep the baddies away
You can invite WatchDog to your servers, and thus enable the use of our list database filled to the brim with baddies, using these invite links:
